# NYU-DS_CRS_HW1
A Course Registration System built for Homework One in Professor Bari's Data Structures Class at NYU

This Program is runnable via the CRS.jar file through the Java Runtime Environment.
It can be launched via the command line by navigating to the program folder location and typing "java -jar CRS.jar".

Thank you to my TA Alan for helping me with this project.
