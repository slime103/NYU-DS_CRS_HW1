# NYU-DS_CRS_HW1
A Course Registration System built for Homework One in Professor Bari's Data Structures Class at NYU

This Program is runnable via the CRS.jar file through the Java Runtime Environment.
It can be launched via the command line by navigating to the program folder location and typing "java -jar CRS.jar".

The username and password for the Admin is "Admin", "Admin001".

Students will not be populated until they are added by the admin. You must then log-in as each student to begin enrolling in courses.

The program could be further improved with a user interface and the ability to find and distinguish students with the same name.

Thank you to my TA Alan for helping me with this project.
